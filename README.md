Intent       : learning purposes

Languages: HTML, Javascript, PHP
API      : WeatherOnline

Progam will take in user input of a specific city and will build
a url to get weather conditions in JSON format.  It will be parsed
for specific values then printed to our HTML page.

- Javascript was used to contact the API even though PHP can also 
  be used.

Goal: learning simple to use API as well as parse the JSON file in
an effective manner.
